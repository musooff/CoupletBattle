# CoupletBattle
CoupletBattle Байтбарак  is a type of game in which a person starts by reciting a couplet and the opponent would continue with another couplet that starts with the letter that the first person's couplet finishes. And the first person continues with the same rule. It is slightly variation of the original Baytbarak where in our game the number of players are infinite and any one can play.
